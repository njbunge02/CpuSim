To compile you need to run in the command line:
    make run

To clean the compile you can run:
    make clean

To change which test script you want to run can change the configuration in the 
makeFile by changing the input file to whichever test case you want, or you can compile manually by:
    g++ main.cpp -o a.out

To run the program manually you can execute:
    ./a.out test1.s output.dat

(you can swap out whichever input file you want)
